In practice, it is best not to try to attach too much physical signi!cance to these stress
measures. Cauchy stress is the best physical measure of internal force: it is the force per
unit area acting inside the deformed solid. "e other stress measures are best regarded
as generalized forces (in the sense of Lagrangian mechanics), which are work conjugate
to particular strain measures. "is means that the stress measure multiplied by the time
derivative of the strain measure tells you the rate of work done by the forces. When setting up any mechanics problem, we always work with conjugate measures of motion and
forces.  
$$
\dot W = D_{ij}\sigma_{ij}dV = D_{ij}\tau_{ji}dV_0 = \dot F_{ij}S_{ji}dV_0 
$$
where Dij is the stretch tensor, dot Fij is rate of change of deformation gradient, and dot Eij is the rate of change of Lagrange strain tensor.

The concept of stress is vital in the derivation of the equations of motion.
$$
\int_S \bold t dS + \int_V \rho \bold g dV = \int _V \rho \ddot {\bold u}dV = \int_S \bold n \cdot \sigma dS + \int_V \rho \bold g dV 
$$
where n is the outward unit vector at boundary of the body. The divergence theorem can now be employed to give
$$
\int_V(\nabla \cdot \sigma + \rho \bold g - \rho \ddot{\bold u}) dV = 0
$$
we must require that locally
$$
\nabla \cdot \sigma + \rho \bold g = \rho \ddot{\bold u}
$$
Above equation can be recast in a compact matrix-vector format
$$
\bold L^T \sigma + \rho \bold g = \rho \ddot {\bold u}
$$
we introduce the operator matrix L
$$
\bold L^T = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial }{\partial x} & 0 & 0  & \frac{\partial }{\partial y} & 0 & \frac{\partial }{\partial z} \\ 0 & \frac{\partial }{\partial y} & 0 & \frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial }{\partial z} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} & 0 & \frac{\partial }{\partial y} & \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\int_V \delta \bold u^T(\bold L^T \sigma + \rho \bold g = \rho \ddot {\bold u})dV = 0
$$
we next apply the divergence theorem to obtain
$$
\int_V(\rho \delta \bold u^T \ddot{\bold u} + (\bold L \delta \bold u)^T \sigma)dV = \int_V \rho \delta \bold u^T \bold g dV + \int_S \delta \bold u^T \bold tdS

section 2.3.1

Linear Momentum Balance in Terms of Cauchy Stress

Newton`s third law of motion F = ma can be expressed as
$$
\nabla_y \cdot \vec \sigma + \rho \vec b = \rho \vec a \qquad \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial y_i} + \rho b_j = \rho a_j
$$
written out in full
$$
\frac{\partial \sigma_{11}}{\partial y_1} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{21}}{\partial y_2} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{31}}{\partial y_3} + \rho b_1 = \rho a_1 \\\frac{\partial \sigma_{12}}{\partial y_1} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{22}}{\partial y_2} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{32}}{\partial y_3} + \rho b_2 = \rho a_2 \\
\frac{\partial \sigma_{13}}{\partial y_1} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{23}}{\partial y_2} + \frac{\partial \sigma_{33}}{\partial y_3} + \rho b_3 = \rho a_3 \\
$$
other stress
$$
\frac{\partial S_{ij}}{\partial x_i} + \rho b_j = \rho a_j \qquad  \frac{\partial (\Sigma_{ik}F_{jk})}{\partial x_i} + \rho b_j = \rho a_j
$$
section 2.4.1

work done by Cauchy stresses
$$
D_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial y_j} + \frac{\partial v_j}{\partial y_i}) 
$$
rate of work done by cauchy stresses per unit deformed volume is then sigmaij Dij. 这部分的能量以热能的形式消耗了，或者以内能存储在固体中。以下一种也可以

分布是Kirchhoff stress, nominal stress, material stress do the work rate per unit undeformed volume
$$
\tau_{ij}D_{ij} \qquad S_{ij}\dot F_{ji} \qquad \Sigma_{ij}\dot E_{ij}
$$
