work done by external work
$$
U_e = \int_0^u \overline F d\overline u \qquad \overline u = \frac{\overline F l}{EA} 
$$
yields
$$
U_e = \frac{EA}{l}\frac{u^2}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{F^2l}{EA} = \frac{1}{2}Fu
$$
then determine the work Ui that is done by the internal forces in the bar.
$$
dU_i = \frac{1}{2}N\varepsilon dx = \frac{1}{2}\frac{N^2}{EA}dx = U_i^*dx
$$
the work done by internal forces is called internal work or strain energy. Uistar is the strain energy per unit length

In words: the work Ue done by the external loads is stored as strain energy U
