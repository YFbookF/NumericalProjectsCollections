Effcient Linear Elastic Models of Soft Tissues for Real-time Surgery Simulation  

For linear Elastic material, the elastic energy W measuring the amount of deformation is defined as
$$
W = \frac{\lambda}{2}(trE)^2 + \mu trE^2
$$
Green-St venant strain tensor
$$
E = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \bold U + \nabla \bold U^T)
$$
然后让势能对位置P求导可得F
$$
\bold F = \frac{\partial W}{\partial \bold P}
$$
