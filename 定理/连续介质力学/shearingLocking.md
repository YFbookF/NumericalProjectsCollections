Shear locking, which is also a source of numerical problems in beam and plate problems,
is the result of excessive shear stresses. For thin elements, the cross section is expected to
remain perpendicular to the element centerline or midsurface of the element. This is the basic
assumption used in Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. Elements that are based on this theory do not
allow for shear deformation, and therefore, such elements do not, in general, suffer from the
shear locking problem. Examples of these elements are the two-dimensional Euler–Bernoulli
beam element and the three-dimensional cable element discussed previously in this chapter.
These elements, as demonstrated in the literature, are efficient in thin-beam applications. Shear
deformable elements, on the other hand, can suffer from locking problems if they are used in
thin structure applications. When these elements are used, the cross section does not remain
perpendicular to the element centerline, leading to shear forces. For thin structures, the resulting shear stresses can be very high leading to numerical problems. This problem can be circumvented by using the elastic line or midsurface approaches, the mixed variational principles,
or reduced integration methods.
