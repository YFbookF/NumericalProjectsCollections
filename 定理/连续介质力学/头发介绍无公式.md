==Super-Helices for Predicting the Dynamics of Natural Hair  

人类的头发是极细的结构，大约0.1毫米半径，界面为圆或椭圆。

The internal structure of the shaft consists of three concentric layers from the core to the periphery: a central canal called medulla;
the cortex, i.e. cells filled with keratin, contributing 90% of the total weight; and the cuticle, a thin coating covered by tilted scales.
Keratin is a remarkably stiff material, making the shaft extremely
difficult to shear and stretch. However, because its cross section is
very small, it can be easily bent and twisted.  

hair strand 的旋转并不小，所以只能有非线性方程。这种非线性带来的影响叫做bulking。如果两个头发部分靠的很近，那么就会被bending所影响。如果靠的更近，那么bending就会转换为twist。

Due to the lightness
of a strand, these friction forces are much higher than other external
forces. This explains the strong cohesion observed in hair motion
