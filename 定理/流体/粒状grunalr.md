===============Simulation of High-Resolution Granular Media  

As discussed earlier, there are two basic ways of modeling
granular particles: either as spherical or non-spherical particles. Spherical particles have shown limitations inherent to
their own geometry, such as the inability to properly model
the maximum angle of repose in piles, or other phenomena
induced by static friction [LH93]. Non-spherical particles  

were investigated as a way to solve those problems. Fig. 2
shows a close-up of sand grains, whose irregular shape has a
large influence on their macroscopic behavior

In reality, a granular medium is governed by microscopic
mechanical behavior, i.e., the interactions between millions
of grains. The microscopic state of the particles could then
be defined by the contact forces acting on the individual particles. However, the behavior of granular flow at a
macroscopic level can be qualitatively characterized even
by relatively rough models with coarsely sampled particles [BKMS07]. In particular, the macroscopic behavior of
a granular medium is characterized by its relative density,
which is defined by the void ratio [AVS03]. Intuitively, a
coarse granular simulation, such as the one described in
Section 3, will maintain the qualitative behavior of a highresolution simulation provided that the porosity and shape of
the grains are maintained.
