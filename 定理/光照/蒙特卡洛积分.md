Crash Course in BRDF Implementation  

pdf
$$
F = \frac{f(x)}{pdf(x)} \qquad I = \frac{\frac{diffuse_reflectance}{\pi}(N\cdot L)}{pdf(L)}
$$
I是 weight of the sample  ，Most basic sampling method, which is actually a great choice for Lambertian and other diffuse BRDFs is sampling in a cosine-weighted hemisphere, with   
$$
pdf(x) = \frac{N * L}{\pi}
$$
这样采样函数就变成了
$$

I = diffuse\_reflectance
$$
we must calculate the vector 𝑅 (vector -𝐿 reflected along the normal), but as shown by Blinn
in his optimized version [17], the half vector 𝐻 can be used instead. To implement sample function in our code we use a method found in Ray Tracing Gems [15]  

Disney (Burley) Diffuse Model  
$$
f_{disney}(L,V) = \frac{diffuse\_reflectanc}{\pi}\\(1 + (F_{D90}-1)(1-\cos\theta_1)^5)(1 + (F_{D90}-1)(1-\cos\theta_v)^5)\\
F_{D90} = 0.5+2 roughnes \cos^2 \theta_
$$
