Crash Course in BRDF Implementation

$$
F = \frac{f(x)}{pdf(x)} \qquad I = \frac{\frac{diffuse_reflectance}{\pi}(N\cdot L)}{pdf(L)}
$$
I是 weight of the sample  ，Most basic sampling method, which is actually a great choice for Lambertian and other diffuse BRDFs is sampling in a cosine-weighted hemisphere, with   
$$
pdf(x) = \frac{N * L}{\pi}
$$
这样采样函数就变成了
$$
I = diffuse\_reflectance
$$
we must calculate the vector 𝑅 (vector -𝐿 reflected along the normal), but as shown by Blinn
in his optimized version [17], the half vector 𝐻 can be used instead. To implement sample function in our code we use a method found in Ray Tracing Gems [15]

For efficient Monte-Carlo light transport simulation, it is vital to sample paths between camera and light sources which transfer the highest amount of energy while, at the same time, avoid wasting computational time on sampling irrelevant paths.
