When light enters a cloud, the majority of the light rays spend their time refracting through water droplets and ice inside of the cloud before scattering toward
our eyes [Van De Hulst 57]. There are three things that can happen to a photon
entering a cloud (see also Figure 24.19):
\1. It can be absorbed by water or non-participating particles in the cloud such
as dust; this is extinction or absorption.
\2. It can exit the cloud toward the eye; this is in-scattering.
\3. It could exit the cloud traveling away from the eye; this is out-scattering.
Beerâ€™s law is a standard method for approximating the probability of each of
these three outcomes.  

Our system also models the darker bases of rain clouds. Rain clouds are darker
than other low-level clouds because the water droplets have condensed so much
that most of the light gets absorbed before reaching our eye  ****
