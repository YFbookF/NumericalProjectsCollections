=================Path tracing in Production
Part 1: Modern Path Tracing  

The most important case, however, is chromatic extinction in participating media. That is, the extinction coefficient μt(x, λ) depends on the wavelength. This governs the transmittance term equation (25) which is simply
exp(-μt(λ) ⋅ d) for homogeneous media. The mean free path in the medium 1/μt depends on the wavelength in
chromatic media,resulting in very different importance sampling strategies for red vs. blue photons.
This is important for instance when using fully ray traced sub-surface scattering in skin: skin has a particular
look that scatters red light farther than blue light. This is the reason why black and white portrait photography
looks smoother with a red filter
