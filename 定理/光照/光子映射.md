Photon mapping is one of a family of particle-tracing algorithms, which are based on the
idea of constructing paths starting from the lights and connecting vertices in these paths
to the camera to deposit energy on the film.   



A particle-tracing algorithm generates a set of N samples of illumination at points pj, on
surfaces in the scene  



The photon mapping algorithm is based on tracing particles into the scene and blurring
their contribution to approximate the incident illumination at shading points.   



按理来说光源朝镜面发射的光一定会打到漫反射物体，这个时候漫反射物体就会比较亮。  想象一下一个晴朗的早晨，你用镜子反射太阳光照到教室的墙壁上。

那么bounce 的时候，每一步都需要和光线测相交

可能您听过双向路径追踪这个技术，即从光发出光线，构成光路径，同时从相机发出光线，构成光路
径，然后将两个路径的每个漫反射节点分别连接，根据联合概率密度，计算光照强度

=============Realistaic Image Synthesis

Instead of tightly coupling lighting information with the geometry, the information is stored in a separate independent data structure

section 3.1

光子总是走直线，且在行走中radiance 保持不变。that light scattering at surface is symmetric。

```
struct photon
{
	float x,y,z;	//position
	char p[4];		//power packed as 4 chars
	char phi,theta; //compressed incident direction
	short flag;		//f
}
```

==============================A Practical Guide to Global Illumination using Photon Maps  

Monte Carlo ray tracing methods such as path tracing, bidirectional path
tracing, and Metropolis can simulate all global illumination effects in complex
scenes with very little memory overhead. The main benefit of the photon map
compared with these methods is efficiency, and the price paid is the extra memory used to store the photons. For most scenes the photon map algorithm is
significantly faster, and the result looks better since the error in the photon map
method is of low frequency which is less noticeable than the high frequency noise
of general Monte Carlo methods  

我们只存储打到diffuse表面上的光子，而不存储打到specular 表面的光子，因为the probability of having a matching incoming photon from the specular direction is zero,   

究竟要存什么？

For each photon-surface interaction, the position, incoming photon power, and incident direction are stored. (For practical reasons, there is also space reserved for a flag with each set of photon data. The flag is used during sorting and look-up in the photon map. More on this in the following.)  

一个光子在反射的过程可能要存几次，并且只有在光子在被diffuse表面吸收的才存。因此数据结构中的每个数据是这样

```
Struct photon
{
	float x,y,z;	// position
	char p[4]; 		// power packed as 4 chars
	char phi,theta; // compressed incident direction
	short flag; 	// flag used in kdtree
}
```

The power of the photon is represented compactly as 4 bytes using Ward’s packed rgb-format [Ward91].  

The incident direction is a mapping of the spherical coordinates of the photon direction to 65536 possible directions. They are computed as: 

```
phi = 255 * (atan2(dy,dx) + PI) / (2 * PI);
theta = 255 * acos(dx) / PI;
```

当光子穿过介质的时候，既有可能被吸收，也有可能被散射。介质的密度越大，光子碰撞的距离越小。

The photon map can be seen as a representation of the incoming flux;   to compute radiance we need to integrate this information.  

If the number of photons in the photon map is too low, the radiance estimates becomes blurry at the edges. This artifact can be pleasing when the photon map is used to estimate indirect illumination for a distribution ray tracer (see section 4 and Figure 15) but it is unwanted in situations where the radiance estimate represents caustics. Caustics often have sharp edges and it would be nice to preserve these edges without requiring too many photons  

BRDF 可以被分为两个部分，specular/glossy 以及 diffuse
$$
f_r(x,\vec w,\vec w') = f_{r,s}(x,\vec w,\vec w') + f_{r,d}(x,\vec w,\vec w')
$$
 The incoming radiance is classified using three components L_il is direction illumination, L_ic is caustics, L_id is indirect illumintaion 

所以我们可以最终的渲染方程
$$
L_r(x,\vec w) = \int f_r(x,\vec w,\vec w') L_i(x,\vec w')cos \theta_i dw'_i \\
= \int f_r(x,\vec w,\vec w') L_{(x,\vec w')cos \theta_i dw'_i \\
+ \int f_{r,s}(x,\vec w,\vec w')(L_{i,c}(x,\vec w') + L_{i,d}(x,\vec w'))cos \theta_i dw'_i \\
+ \int f_{r,d}(x,\vec w,\vec w') L_{i,c}(x,\vec w')cos \theta_i dw'_i \\
+ \int f_{r,d}(x,\vec w,\vec w') L_{i,d}(x,\vec w')cos \theta_i dw'_i 
$$
