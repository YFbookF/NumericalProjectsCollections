===================gpu pro lighting

ne way to quickly render complex lighting is instant radiosity [Keller 97], which
is actually a bit of a misnomer. Instant radiosity can be thought of as a variant
of bidirectional path tracing [Lafortune and Willems 93], where paths are traced
from both the light source and the viewpoint and then combined to reduce variance in the computed illumination. Figure 1.1 depicts how instant radiosityâ€™s
bidirectional approach works. First photons are emitted from the light. These
photons may bounce a number of times, and each photon-surface intersection
becomes a virtual point light (or VPL). In the second stage, paths from the eye
are emitted and each intersection along the path gathers direct light from both
the VPLs and original lights.
