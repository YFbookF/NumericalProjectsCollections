=================Path tracing in Production
Part 1: Modern Path Tracing  

Themain challengefor efficient pathsampling lies in devisingsampling distributions that areroughly proportional
to f and at thesame time efficient to drawsamplesfrom. In practice,there aremultiplesamplingstrategies available
that are each tailored to resemble a specific part of f accurately while being less accurate on other parts. Veach has
proposed amethod for combiningmultiple importance sampling techniques into asingle estimate,called Multiple
Importance Sampling. This approach seeks to draw samples from multiple distributions and combine them in a
weighted average that aims to automatically adjust to give preference to the technique that is best suited to sample
a specific contribution:  
$$
I = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t\in T}w_t(\bold x_j)\frac{f_j (\bold x_j)}{p_t(\bold x_j)}
$$
The beauty of MIS is that it allows to modularize light transport into separate sampling techniques for which the weighting adjusts itself automatically. It has hence become a key building block for probably all production path tracing renderers.   



Even in homogeneous media,the nice simplifications between path contribution and pdf are no longer possiblewhen the densities are colors because the pdf itself must always be ascalar. Thesolution to this problem is to incorporatemultiple importancesampling to combine the probability of sampling from eachwavelengthseparately
