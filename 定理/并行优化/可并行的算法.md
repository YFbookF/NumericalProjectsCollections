==================Vivace: a Practical Gauss-Seidel Method for Stable Soft Body Dynamics  

并行高斯赛德尔图着色

In Alg. 2, we define a simple, randomized algorithm belonging
to the class of Brooks-Vizing vertex coloring algorithms [Grable
and Panconesi 2000]. These algorithms are appealing because they
are simple to implement, fast, and use considerably fewer than ∆
colors, where ∆ is the maximal degree of the graph. As input,
we consider graphs representing physically animated objects discretized as triangular or tetrahedral meshes. Such meshes are composed of hundreds of thousands of vertices connected by constraints
(e.g., distance, bending and volume constraints), however ∆ is low
enough to enable real-time colorings
