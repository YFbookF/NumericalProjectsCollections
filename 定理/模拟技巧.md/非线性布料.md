Multiresolution approach. Cloth simulation based on subdivision surface finite elements has the advantage of higher-order
convergence under mesh refinement as compared to simpler finite
elements or approximations thereof. We use this feature to speed
up our fitting process. In particular, we run each fitting solve using
a comparatively coarse mesh resolution to describe each simulated
experiment. The resulting parameters are then used as an initial
guess for a higher resolution fitting solve. This process may be
repeated as many times as desired to obtain satisfactory convergence of high-resolution fitting solves more quickly than would
be possible without such a means of generating initial guesses. In
practice, we typically use this technique only for the solves involving tensile data. For canvas, cotton and silk, we use an 8×12 grid of
finite elements for our coarsest meshes. Then we progress upward
through resolutions 16 × 24 and finally 32 × 48 to refine the fit. For
denim and wool we use 8 × 24, 16 × 48, and 32 × 96 grids.
