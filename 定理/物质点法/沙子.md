=========Three-dimensional granular flow continuum modeling via material point method with hyperelastic nonlocal granular fluidity  

In this regime, however, granular materials have similarities with viscoplastic fluids such as Bingham and
Herschel-Bulkley fluids [31] which are time- (or rate-)
dependent as  
$$
\frac{d \gamma}{d t} = \frac{d \gamma ^ e}{dt} + \frac{d \gamma^p}{dt} = \dot{\gamma}^e + \dot{\gamma}^p
$$
塑性模型会遭受rate - independency.

The change rate of deformation gradient can be obtained by
$$
\dot{\bold F} = \bold L \bold F \qquad \bold L = \frac{\partial \bold v}{\partial \bold x}
$$
L = dv/dx is approximation by the apic transfer scheme.

and the elastic deformation gradient is calculated by
$$
\bold F^e = \bold F(\bold F^p)^{-1}
$$
MPM - NGF

```
Matrix dg_el = this->dg_t * inverse(this->dg_p);  // dg_e @ tr
```



Then the equivalent plastic shear straint
$$
\dot{\gamma}^p = gu
$$

```

```

$$
\bold L_{n+1}^p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\dot{\gamma}^p_{n+1}\bold N_{tr}^p
$$



```
Me = Me - 1.414_f * (tau_trial-this->tau) * Np;  // Me @ n+1
```

更新塑性变形梯度的方式为
$$
\bold F_{n+1}^p = \bold F_{n}^p(\bold I + \Delta t\bold L_{n+1}^p)
$$


```
this->dg_p =  // dg_p @ n+1
        (I + delta_t * 0.707_f * mu * this->gf * Np) * this->dg_p;
```

```
real tau_trial = 0.707_f * Me_0_mag; // tau @ tr
if (tau_trial > 0.0_f) Np = (0.707_f / tau_trial) * Me_0; // Np @ tr
else Np = Matrix(0.0_f);
