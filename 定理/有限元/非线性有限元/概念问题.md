The pure displacement version of the finite element method is the most convenient spatial discretisation method for the majority of the applications of non-linear constitutive relations. Its formulation is simple, and allows for a straightforward implementation of complicated constitutive relations. However, in some cases the displacement version of the finite element method ceases to give accurate results. In such cases one usually has to resort to mixed or hybrid methods, e.g. Chapters 7 or 11. These methods tend to give answers that are more accurate than pure displacement models, but there is an increased risk of improper element behaviour. This is already the case for linear elastic material behaviour, but if material non-linearities are incorporated, the possibility that spurious kinematic modes in elements are triggered is far greater. In fact, this is another reason why pure displacement-based methods are often preferred in finite element analyses involving material non-linearities such as plasticity or damage. We shall therefore now outline displacement-based finite element models and the structure of non-linear finite element codes based upon this concept.
