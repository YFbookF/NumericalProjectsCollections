Super-Helices for Predicting the Dynamics of Natural Hair  

The centerline, r(s,t), is the
curve passing through the center of mass of every cross section.
This curve describes the shape of the rod at a particular time t but
it does not tell how much the rod twists around its centerline. In
order to keep track of twist, the Cosserat model introduces a material frame ni(s,t) at every point of the centerline2. By material,
we mean that the frame ‘flows’ along with the surrounding material
upon deformation.
