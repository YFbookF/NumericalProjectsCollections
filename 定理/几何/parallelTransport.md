Before defining a general notion of curvature for an arbitrary space, we need to know how to compare vectors
at different positions on a manifold. Parallel transport provides a way to compare a vector in one tangent
plane to a vector in another, by moving the vector along a curve without changing it.

Suppose we have a tangent vector u=df(X) sitting on an immersed surface f(M). How do we move from one point of the surface to another while preserving the direction of u? If f(M) is completely flat (like the plane itself) then the most natural thing is to slide u from one point to the other along a straight path—keeping the angle with some reference direction fixed—to obtain a new vector u′. This process is called *parallel transport*, and the tangent vectors u and u′ are, as usual, said to be *parallel*. Parallel transport on a *curved* surface is a bit trickier. If we keep u pointing in the same direction, then it ceases to be tangent and now sticks out the side. On the other hand, if we instead keep u flat against the surface then we no longer have a consistent, global reference direction. Overall, the notion of “same direction” is not very well-defined!
