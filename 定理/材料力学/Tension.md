the resulting stress is obtained through superposition
$$
\sigma = \frac{N}{A} + \frac{M_y}{I_y}z - \frac{M_z}{I_z}y
$$
in the case of ordinary bending about the y-axis Mz = 0

The bending moments cause the deflection w(x) and v(x),whereas the normal force causes only a displacement u(x) in the direction of the beam axis.
