罚函数矩阵
$$
\Pi = \frac{1}{2}\bold D^T \bold K \bold D - \bold D^T \bold R + \frac{1}{2}\bold t^T \alpha \bold t
$$
where alpha = [a1,a2,a3 ... am] is a diagonal matrix of "penalty numbers", chosen by the analyst and prederably

然后继续Pi对D求导
$$
(\bold K + \bold C^T \alpha \bold C) \bold D = \bold R + \bold C^T \alpha \bold Q
$$

最后罚函数矩阵如下
$$
\bold C = \sqrt{k} - \sqrt{k} \qquad (\begin{bmatrix} k & -k \\ -k & 2k \end{bmatrix} + \alpha \begin{bmatrix} k & -k \\ -k & k\end{bmatrix})\begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} P \\ 0\end{bmatrix}
$$
结果为
$$
u_1 = \frac{2 + \alpha}{1 + \alpha}\frac{P}{k} \qquad u_2 = \frac{P}{k}
$$
if alpha = 0, the constraint are ignored. As alpha becomes large, the penalty of violating constraint becomes large, so that constraints are very satisfied. Penalty numbers that are too large produce numerical ill-condition-ing, which may make computed results unrealiable and may even lock the mesh.

===================Physically Based Modeling Constrained Dynamics  

Penalty constraints work, to the extent they do, because the restoring forces cancel applied forces
that would otherwise break the constraints. The fundamental difficulty with penalty constraints is
that the applied forces and restoring forces communicate only indirectly, through displacements.
In effect, the displacements produced by applied forces act as signals that tell the constraint what
restoring force is required. This is not a good communication mechanism because it is impossible
to acheive accuracy without stiffness.
