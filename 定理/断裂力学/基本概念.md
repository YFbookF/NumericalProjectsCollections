A brittle fracture releases most of its elastic energy thus allowing the crack to  proceed further into the material and reducing the energy required to break it. As a consequence, brittle objects generally shatter

### energy release rate 

==============Fracture Mechanics Fundumentals and application

G, which is a measure of the energy available for an increment of crack extension
$$
\mathcal G = -\frac{d\Pi}{dA} = \frac{\pi \sigma^2 a}{E} =\frac{dW_s}{dA} = 2w_f
$$
G is the rate of change in potential energy with the crack area. Since G is obtained from the derivative of a potential, it is also called the crack extension force or the crack driving force. 

It is convenient at this point to introduce the compliance, which is the inverse of the plate stiffness:  
$$
C = \frac{\Delta }{P}
$$
By substituting Equation (2.29) into Equation (2.27) and Equation (2.28) it can be shown that  
$$
\mathcal G = \frac{P^2}{2B}\frac{dC}{da}
$$
for both load control and displacement control. Therefore, the energy release rate, as defined in
Equation (2.23), is the same for load control and displacement control. Also  
$$
(\frac{dU}{da})_p = - (\frac{dU}{da})_{\Delta}
$$
In load control,
a crack extension da results in a net increase in strain energy because of the contribution of the
external force P  

The Griffith energy balance for an incremental increase in the crack area dA, under
equilibrium conditions, can be expressed in the following way  
$$
\frac{dE}{dA} = \frac{d\Pi}{dA} + \frac{dW}{dA} = 0
$$
where

E = total energy
Π = potential energy supplied by the internal strain energy and external forces
Ws = work required to create new surfaces

for the cracked plate illustrated in figure2.3 griffith used the stress analysis of inlics to show that
$$
\Pi  = \Pi_o - \frac{\pi \sigma^2 a^2 B}{E}
$$
Since the
formation of a crack requires the creation of two surfaces, Ws is given by  
$$
W_S = 4aB \gamma_s
$$
Gammas is the surface energy of the material, thus
$$
-\frac{d\Pi}{dA} = \frac{\pi \sigma^2 a}{E}
$$
solving for the fracture stress gives
$$
\sigma_f = \sqrt{\frac{2E\gamma_s}{\pi a}}
$$
Equation (2.19) is valid only for ideally brittle solids. Griffith obtained a good agreement between
Equation (2.19) and the experimental fracture strength of glass, but the Griffith equation severely
underestimates the fracture strength of metals.  

===============应用断裂力学

裂纹的出现使固体出现了新表面，此表面具有表面能，系统所释放能量U的一部分将转换为表面能。能量释放情况可写为
$$
\Pi = U - P\Delta \qquad d\Pi = dU - P d\Delta - \Delta dP
$$


当加载点固定时，外载荷不做功，dDelta = 0，裂纹扩展只能由构件释放出来的应变能来提供，导致应变能减少。
$$
G = -(\frac{\partial U}{\partial A})_{\Delta}
$$
负号表示应变能随着裂纹面积的增加而减少，即释放应变能。

当外载荷不变,dP = 0
$$
d\Pi = -dU \qquad G = (\frac{\partial U}{\partial A})_p
$$
在外载荷不变而裂纹发生扩展时，外力所作功为PdDelta，一半用于增加结构应变能，另一半用于推动裂纹扩展。

上面一应变能差率，也就是裂纹从a扩展到a + da时的应变能变化率，称为裂纹假想扩展da的能量释放率。

### R curve

==============Fracture Mechanics Fundumentals and application

Crack extension occurs when G = 2wf; but crack growth may be stable or unstable, depending on
how G and wf vary with crack size. To illustrate stable and unstable behavior, it is convenient to
replace 2wf with R, the material resistance to crack extension. A plot of R vs. crack extension is
called a resistance curve or R curve. The corresponding plot of G vs. crack extension is the driving
force curve.  

Unstable crack growth occurs when  
$$
\frac{d\mathcal{G}}{da} > \frac{dR}{da}
$$
The R curve for an ideally brittle material is flat because the surface energy is an invariant
material property. When nonlinear material behavior accompanies fracture, however, the R curve
can take on a variety of shapes. For example, ductile fracture in metals usually results in a rising
R curve; a plastic zone at the tip of the crack increases in size as the crack grows. The driving
force must increase in such materials to maintain the crack growth. If the cracked body is infinite
(i.e., if the plastic zone is small compared to the relevant dimensions of the body) the plastic zone
size and R eventually reach steady-state values, and the R curve becomes flat with further growth
(see Section 3.5.2).  

### Crack Growth

the stability of crack growth depends on the rate of change in G, i.e., the second derivative of potential energy.  

### LOAD CONTROL VS. DISPLACEMENT CONTROL  

Displacement control tends to be more stable than load control. With some configurations, the
driving force actually decreases with crack growth in displacement control. A typical example is
illustrated in Figure 2.11.

### K

===============应用断裂力学

K是应力强度因子，当K > Kc时，裂纹尖端因局部起裂而突然断裂，这种断裂形式，称为脆性断裂。

Since the remote stress σ is perpendicular to the crack
plane, the loading is pure Mode I.   

stres intensity has units of (stress sqrt length). Since the only relevant length scale is the crack size, the relationship between K1 and the global conditions must have the following form
$$
K_1 = O(\sigma \sqrt{a}) \qquad K_1 = \sigma\sqrt{\pi a}
$$

### CRACK-TIP PLASTICITY  

The stress intensity due to the closure stress can be estimated by considering a normal force
P applied to the crack at a distance x from the centerline of the crack (Figure 2.32). The stress
intensities for the two crack tips are given by  
$$
K_{I+a} = \frac{P}{\sqrt{\pi a}}\sqrt{\frac{a + x}{a - x}}
$$
============应用断裂力学

裂纹尖端可能有塑性区
$$
\sigma_y = \frac{K_1}{\sqrt{2\pi r}} \qquad r = \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{K^2}{\sigma^2}
$$
